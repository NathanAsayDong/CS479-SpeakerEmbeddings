**1. Abstract** **(2 points)**

- Provides a concise summary of the project.
- Briefly covers the problem, the approach/methodology used, key results, and main conclusions.
- Engages the reader and clearly states the project's contribution or focus.

**2. Introduction (4 points)**

- **(Problem Definition & Motivation):** Clearly defines the specific MT problem or task being addressed. Explains the motivation and significance of the project.
- **(Objectives):** States clear, specific objectives or expected outcomes for the project.
- **(Organization):** Briefly outlines the structure of the rest of the paper.

**3. Related Work (4 points)**

- Minimum of 4 references.
- Summarizes relevant existing approaches, models, or papers in the specific area of MT the project addresses.
- Discusses how the current project relates to this prior work (e.g., builds upon, differs from, addresses limitations of).
- Demonstrates understanding of the project's context within the field.
- Citations are used appropriately for all referenced work.

**4. Dataset (2 points)**

- Clearly describes the datasets/corpora used (source, size, language pairs, preprocessing steps).
- Provides sufficient detail for a reader to understand the resources involved.

**5. Methodology (6 points)**

- Provides a clear and detailed description of the project's technical approach.
- Explains the architecture of the MT system(s) built or used.
- Details the algorithms implemented or applied.
- Clearly defines the inputs and outputs of the system/components.
- Includes sufficient detail that a knowledgeable reader could conceptually understand *how* the project was executed (though not necessarily reproduce it fully without code).

**6. Experiments (6 points)**

- Details the experimental setup (e.g., train/dev/test splits, baseline systems used for comparison, specific evaluation scripts/settings).
- Clearly describes the evaluation methodology used (e.g., automatic metrics like BLEU, METEOR, TER; human evaluation; qualitative analysis). Justifies why the chosen methods are appropriate for the project's goals.

**7. Results & Discussion (6 points)**

- Presents the results clearly and effectively (e.g., using tables, figures/graphs where appropriate).
- **(Analysis & Comparison):** Analyzes the obtained results. Compares results against initial expectations, baseline performance (if applicable), and relevant results from the related work discussed earlier.
- **(Interpretation):** Discusses the implications of the results. What was learned? Were the objectives met? Addresses limitations or unexpected findings.
- **(Qualitative Examples - Optional but Recommended):** May include specific examples of input/output translations to illustrate system performance, strengths, or weaknesses.

**8. Conclusion & Future Work (4 points)**

- **(Conclusion):** Summarizes the key contributions, findings, and takeaways of the project. Briefly reiterates the main message.
- **(Future Work):** Outlines specific, plausible ideas for future research or improvements building upon the current project.

**9. Reflection (1 point)**

- Any spiritual insights working this project has given you or how it could be used or extended to contribute to building the kingdom of God

**Overall Quality & Presentation (5 points)**

- **(Clarity & Writing Style):** Written clearly, concisely, and professionally. Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Demonstrates mastery of the topic through writing.
- **(Organization & Structure):** Logical flow between sections. Effective use of headings and subheadings. Follows a structure appropriate for a technical report/article.
- **(Formatting & Length):** Adheres to any specified formatting guidelines (e.g., template, font, margins, citation style) and length constraints. If using the ACL LaTeX template, a minimum of 4 pages is required (not including references). If using APA style, a minimum of 8 pages is required (not including references or title page).

**(References):** Includes a properly formatted bibliography/reference list for all cited works. Use APA style if you do not use the ACL LaTeX template.

**PROJECT NOTES**
- Nov 25: Initial Code Setup
    - Built: 
        - ASR Class
        - Translation Class
        - TTS Class
- Nov 25: Tested Embeddings
    - Pipeline uses a 5 second clip and generates embeddings that are passed into the model for zero shot prompting
    - Output was pretty bad
- Nov 25: Larger reference embeddings
    - Instead of taking the 5 second input and using the translation speech for the embeddings as well, we use the reference speech that is much longer to use a embeddings for ourput voice
    - 10 seconds reference speech
- MAYBE NEW TOPIC?
 --> How much reference speech is needed for an effective voice cloning model
